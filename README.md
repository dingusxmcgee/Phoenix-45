 Phoenix-45



The Phoenix 45 case is a 3D printable case for the Phoenix 45 PCB by projectcain, KnoblesseOblige and Dingusxmcgee. 


The intention behind this project was to bring the classic JD45 keyboard back to life with updated features like USB-C connection and rotary encoder support! The 3D printable case was created to make the board available to everyone in addition to original JD45 case owners. 


The 3DP case is a top-mount design, available to be printed with a HHKB, WKL, or Standard aesthetic. 
It can be built to have zero incline, or 5 degrees with the optional feet installed. 


The build requires fifteen M2 self-tapping screws (8mm long), and four 20x2mm bumpons for the feet.
